A 3D platformer game where you navigate to retrieve all the green boxes.

This was a game I created to learn more about OpenGL with the use of C, Objective-C, and C++. Although the code, files, and naming convention are fairly messy, and the collision detection code is somewhat buggy at times, I do believe there is a lot of useful code inside for anyone who is starting out and wants to learn more with OpenGL 3.2 on a mac.
